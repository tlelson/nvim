# Neovim config 

This is based on [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim). It makes a lot of nice UI configurations that would take me too long to work out.

## Linters 

Configure them [here](./lua/plugins/lint.lua).  Don't forget to add the linter to the list of [automatically installed executables](./lua/plugins/lsp.lua)
